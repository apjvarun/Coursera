## 1.1-1.2: Marketing 101 Building Strong Brands

*Marketing is the study of a market: an exchange between two entities.*

In the seller’s market, we have product-focused marketing. We should develop the product to the best of our ability. We should sell as much as we can The objective is market share! Product-focused.

In a buyer’s market, what you need is to look at what that customer wants, and deliver something that the customer exactly wants, and create a product to meet their need. Customer-focused. The intuition of customer-focused marketing is to focus on just the customers that you need. Deliver value to a customer, something that they are willing to pay for. If we give things that are exactly what the customer wants, then we might get paid a higher price for it. We can also transact with the customer multiple times. It’s cheaper to retain customers vs. acquiring them.

Connected Community: It’s not a one-to-one conversation anymore. Customers buzzing is good or bad news on every transaction with the customer. This means you need to be transparent and focus on customer experience and customer value.

#### Different Orientations:
- Production Orientation: We want to persuade the customer to want what the firm has.
- Marketing Orientation: We want to persuade the firm to offer what the cx wants.
- Experience Orientation: We want to manager the cx's entire experienece with the firm.
- Trust Orientation: We want to prioritize building a relationship of trust and discipline.

#### 3 Principles
- Customer Value: Give them real, genuine customer value.
- Differentiation: You need to provide this better than the competition.
- Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning: Focus and position to meet the needs of that target segment.

#### 4 Ps
- Product, Place, Promotion, Price
- Seller = product. Buyer = price. Distribution = place.

Ex: Red cross. Blood = price. “Feel good about myself”, sticker, orange juice and cookies, allowing to miss class (for high school) = product.

## 1.3:Strategic Marketing

#### Market-Driven Principles
- *Know Your Markets.* We have to know what customers want, and how competitors react. You have to research and stuff.
- Customers have the final say. The customers will choose what they want, at the end of the day. Now, because of TMI, customers bundle stuff according to: operations factors (costs), product features and design, “whether or not it meets my needs”. _Cx then choose the product that is the best in a specific category, but is sort of decent at the other parts._
- So you have to be the best at some thing, and be good at other things. This affects everything else about a company. 
- Deliver total quality to guarantee customer satisfaction.

#### Fair Value
- Offering more benefits = customers will choose to pay a higher price, as long as it appears to be fair.
- The f-v line constantly changes over time when a part of the market gets saturated.

#### Strategies for Leadership
- In our marketplace, what are we good at? How can we define what’s good in our area?
- Where is “fair value”? What are our customers’ expectations. Sometimes, this is the average of everyone’s perception. Sometimes, this is something impossible.
- Long term: Best at 1, good at the other 2.

## 1.4: Strategic Market Flipchart


What does it mean for you to be “operationally excellent” in your industry?

What does it mean for you to have “superior performance” in your industry?

What does it mean for you to have “customer intimacy” in your industry?

Fair value: What is the expectation that your customer has?

When a new product comes in, we usually start at the middle end. Over time, people get used to and require features.

When you have a mature market, markets get operationally excellent, and price keeps going down and down.

Basically, discover what fair value is, and discover where you are and where the competitors are as well.


Ex: Red short-term: PE (“let’s not get shut out on PE”), and long-term: “we want to be the best at OE”.

## (1.5)/1.6: Segmentation

#### Positioning Process
- Segmentation: Identify variables that allow one to segment the market.
- Targeting: Evaluate the attractiveness of each segment and choose a target segment.
- Positioning: Identify positioning concepts for each target segment, select the best, and communicate it.

Market segmentation is the process of dividing a market into distinct subsets, where any subset may conceivable be selected as a marketing target to be reached with a distinct marketing mix (4Ps).

#### Methods
- Characteristics of the customer: Gender, age, nationality
- Benefits sought
- Purchase behaviors/channels
- Cohort analysis: It’s not whether you are young or old, but the life experiences you have.
	- *Marketers are very interested in people coming of age because many times, you make purchases at this age, and then you become loyal to the brand for a long time.*
	- Generation Y (1977-1997): Likes free content, tele-commuting, everything social, wireless, "the right fit". Dislikes: Anonymous mass marketing, beaten paths, restricted access.
	- Millenials: Big shoppers, creators of social media stuff, connected, socially responsible.
- Geographical segmentation/zip clustering: People who live in the same area tend to be similar to each other (PRIZM segmentation).
- Where you live physically also affects your online behavior.

#### Select a Target Segment: Criteria
- Segment Size
- Growth of Segment
- $ Value of Segment
- Stability
- Current Company position within segment
- Ease of entry
- Ease of competitive entry
- Number and strength of competitors

Balance the attractiveness of the segment with the capability of your company.

## 1.7: Brand Positioning

Formally, a brand is just a proprietary trademark for a specific product or service.

Conceptually, it is a contract from the company to its customers (what you’ve come to expect from a company).

Because people are a connected community, it’s “whatever the customer thinks it is”.

If your message/brand is not so clear, customers create their own perception of you.

#### Positioning Statements

_Apple Computers offers the best personal computing experience to students, educators, creative professionals and consumers around the world through its innovative hardware, software, and Internet offerings._

_IBM... for businesses who need computers, IBM is the company you can trust for all your needs._

*Positioning Statements: Target Segment + Point of Difference + Frame of Reference*

Apple: “Students, educators…” + “Innovative hardware” + “Other companies which provide personal computing”

You have to make a choice. Without a choice you become lukewarm tea!

Positioning affects: strategic vision, product development, and the story you want to impart.

#### Point of Parity
- Associations that are not unique to the brand and are shared with other brands.
- Category POPs: associations consumer views as necessary to be considered credible. Ex: Grocery stores have to have products!
- Competitive POPs: Associations designed to negate competitors point of difference. Ex: All toothpastes “fight cavities”.

### Point of Difference
- Strong, favorable, unique brand associations
- Similar to the notion of USP (unique selling proposition)
- SCA: sustainable competitive advantage
- Are POD desirable to the customer?
- Is POD relevant? (Who the fuck needs clear cola) Is POD distinctive?
- Can you actually deliver the product across: feasibility (pricing), communicability, sustainability (difficult to attack).

## 1.8: Brand Positioning: The Elevator Speech

There’s a lot of ways to do marketing wrong, and only a few ways to do marketing right.

What we actually want to end up is at least an elevator speech or a brand mantra.

#### Mental Map: What comes to mind when you think about X?
- Core Brand Values: The set of abstract concepts or phrases that characterize the five to ten most important dimensions of the mental map of a brand. Then relate that shit.
- Brand Mantra: The brand essence. Create that shit after you get the brand values. Think that everything you do has to fit to that mantra is.

This is used to internally guide decisions: what do we do and what should we not be associated with:

- The *brand function* describes the nature of the product of service or the type of experiences or benefits the brand provides.
- The *descriptive modifier* further clarifies its nature.
- The *emotional modifier* provides another qualifier: how exactly does the brand provide benefits, and in what way?

					Emotional 		Descriptive 	Brand Function
		Nike		Authentic 		Athletic 		Performance		
		Disney		Fun 			Family 			Entertainment
		McDonalds 	Fun 			Family 			Food

## 1.9: Experiential Branding


We don’t just need to be differentiated, other people need to have a different experience when they are with us.

We have a relationship between a customer, and individualized relationship.

Strong brands give an emotional experience.

You want a good experience across all five senses.


You want these across the 4Ps.



Pricing: Think eBay.

Channel: Think of the stores and the lifestyle someone is expecting when they buy your brand.


Every little thing is thought out by people themselves. Sometimes they become religions.


Be consistent, be a superior product, be distinctive, be aligned to the internal and external commitment to the brand, be and stay relevant

2.1: Shopper Marketing

In order to feed the brand of choice, we need to understand the shopping experience from the shopper’s point of view.

Shoppers make impulse purchase decisions.

Shoppers make decisions based on habit, intuition, and emotion.

Shoppers make decisions based on what they see (and miss).

Shoppers think in terms of personal relevance (Who is it for? When do I use it?)

The shopping process is a multi-stage process.


Multiple channel process: online or offline, and it doesn’t matter what time.

As a marketer, you want to make sure your brand is still in contention as the consumer progresses from stage to stage.

2.2: Shopping Process

Sometimes there needs to be a trigger, and companies can help the consumer recognize that they need to do stuff.

If this is not a natural need, then the marketer needs to create the need. Then people pay attention to product/brands related to the category.

If a retailer wants users to get to the store more often, they create shopping goals. There are different signs that remind the consumer that it’s “back to school time”. 

Sometimes, consumers voluntarily give out emails, and the brand sends out people for special sales.

Creating urgency: Online flash sales (both online and offline).

Create news/dialogue using social media: triggers shopping process.
2.3: Information Search Stage

After search for information, consumer come up with a consideration set: things that consumers consider when choosing a product.

The number of brands you can evoke (evoke set) is very small. You start with 50 brands, then evoke set, then consideration set.


Internal search: From the advertising and constant repetition.

If you’re not here, you suck!

You can also create brands through Flagship stores both online and offline (ex: Apple store).
External Search (store)

Goal driven vs. taxonomic: “I need ketchup” means someone goes straight to the ketchup section. “I need something for dinner” means someone is heavily influenced by the store itself.

Social influences: Someone posting a status on Facebook, consumer reviews, and salespeople.
Getting Customers’ Attention

Capacity is limited and information could do so much. Use color blocking!

When redesigning a brand, you have to make sure the redesign is connected to the old design.

You can indicate differently priced items by a different packaging. The same for different flavors. 
2.4: Choice Overload

Once the user has a consideration set, they evaluate the products, and hopefully they make a purchase!

Many times, consumers are overwhelmed, and they just don’t buy stuff. Iyengar’s jam study:


Variety was attractive, but too much choice was overloading.

Perceived variety vs actual variety: When there were 6 colors of jellybeans, they chose more when the 6 flavors were scrambled. When there were 24 colors of jellybeans, they chose more when they were organized (it seems okay) but scrambling it is too much.

So for marketers, the strategy is to have as many choices as possible without getting choice overload.

Get someone to be an “expert” to choose for you.

Align stuff by a category: calories, price, colors, the less amount perceived complexity.

Help consumers learn preferences via an app or something.
2.5: Purchase Stage

Well first, the product has to be in stock. ☺

Assuming that the product is in stock, consumers evaluate:

The price

Increase accessible variety re: multiple purchases.

In supermarkets, consumers are pretty mindless when choosing stuff. Shoppers were not that aware of the price.

Average time between arriving and departing from product category: 12 seconds

85% of purchases: Only the chosen brand was the one they checked out.

21% of shoppers cannot offer a price estimate when asked.

50% were able to state correct price (not absolute, but 93% knew the relative price “I bought the cheapest” “I bought the middle”)

Consumers do not evaluate price absolutely, either:

External: What the marketer sets. Without an anchor, customers have a harder time making a decision. (Ex: low price guarantee, some people just feel better when there is a lower price guarantee).

Internal: What the consumer thinks of. “A can of soda should be $1.”

Interesting color names increases the likelihood of choice!

2.6: Post-Purchase

What matters is if the consumer is satisfied, and if they are going to repeat buy or recommend.

Actually, what a consumer prefers is not the actual performance, but the perceived performance.

This is also subject to specific expectations. The evaluation should be greater than the consumer’s expectations.


If positive, they are more likely to repurchase and tell other people re: word of mouth. Marketers need to manage expectations anyway.

If negative, consumers switch to competitors and spread negative word of mouth (which is 9 times more likely to spread), complaints, lawsuits.

If you address a complaint immediately, you can actually generate a higher satisfaction.
Contagious: What information is likely to be shared?

Social currency: This makes us look good.

Triggers: When people are reminded, they are likely to share.

Emotion: Emotional messages are more powerful.

Public: Making behavior makes it more catching.

Practical: We like to be useful and informative.

Stories: If someone can share stories, then they’d prefer it. “Authentic Salmon Steak”, “Icelandic tuna”.
Shopper Marketing

Be the shopper themselves!

Shoppers make impulse decisions and make decisions based on habit, intuition, and emotion.

So, how does their expectation get managed?

3.1: Brand Messaging and Communication
Perception:

The process of developing an interpretation of a stimulus, or deciding what a stimulus means.

What customers perceive is what affects their actions. What customers perceive is not necessarily true.

Perception is constructive: people construct interpretations as a function of context. The meanings are constructd as needed and are based upon two major factors:

The actual stimulus (exposure and attention). You can choose to just not go to a shady part of town and because of that you won’t be able to change your perspective on it.

For voluntary attention, we have selective attention and exposure.

Once you are able to perceive something, we interpret it depending on previous things that happened in our lives and our prior expectations. So expectations are frequently biased, and they don’t represent what’s true.

Your perceptions affect your subsequent behavior, and it’s very hard to control that even if you say “well I know that I will be biased and I want to prevent that”.

You cannot block this effect because it is an automatic one. It is involuntary.

Proximity bias: When things are closer together, then we interpret it as similar. Implicit!

Similarity bias: things that look alike, people assume they have the same quality.

Ex: When you slap the Coca-Cola brand, even if the product is EXACTLY the same, then they have perception changes, even if they say they aren’t affected by the brand name. Brand is just so popular that the Coca-Cola brand is worth 70B.

Even without knowing anything, people were willing to spend more to purchase Diet Coke.

## 3.2: Elements of a Brand

The brand elements have to work together to provide an identity for the product or service. What would customers think about the product if they only saw the brand elements?

#### Brand Element Choice Criteria
- Memorable: Easily recognized, easily recalled.
- Meaningful: Descriptive, persuasive.
- Appealing: Fun and interesting, aesthetic, rich visual imagery.
- Protectable: Legally, competitively.
- Adaptable: Flexible, updateable.
- Transferable: Within and across product categories, across geographical boundaries and cultures.

#### Brand Elements: Advantages and Disadvantages
- Names: Easy to process, but difficult to change.
- Logos: Attention-getting, can reinforce associations, but can get outdated or misinterpreted.
- Characters: Rich meaning, attention getting, but can slo get outdated or not spread globally.
- Slogans and Jingles: Highly memorable, catchy, conveys meaning, but is difficult to translate.
- Packages (packaging): Recognizable, but there might be concerns in the channel and production.

#### Effects
- Consumers: Affects likelihood of purchase.
- Employess: Affects morale and productivity.
- Firm: Can limit opportunities (new products and new regions) if the brand name sucks.
- Investors: Can cause subconscious judgments about the company’s merits/strengths.

#### Type of Names



Virgin: When Richard Branson thought of creating a record company, one of the girls thought that everyone was still virgins at that point. It’s fun.

Priceline: Very descriptive, quite clear in what it means.

Google: Chosen by mistake, wrong spelling. It plays around itself a ton of times but people are still able to recognize what it is.

Names for New Start-ups: New businesses need their own websites and the URLs have been taken: Mibblio, Kaggle, Zaarly.



Gap rebranding: If you have visual and verbal things in conflict with each other, the visual takes priority first. You are attracted first to the block.

Non-all caps: people think it was a word (which means hole) rather than as a brand.

Brand names in China: Keep your names in your native language because Chinese characters have their own meanings.

3.3: Brand Elements: Colors and Taglines

Rules about color: The ultimate goal is to own a color (which is hard because there aren’t that many colors out there). Ex: Tiffany’s light blue and Mary Kay’s pink.

Color can also be used to separate product lines.

Different viewers experience color differently: ensure consistency of color across platforms and media (this is difficult).

Colors can create very strong perceptions: luxury = gold, silver, black white. Gender = blue and pink.


Rules about Color

Red: stimulates the appetite, means love and passion and excitement and it stimulates appetite.

Blue: color most prefered by men; productive color; curbs appetite.

Green: tranquil, health, money, fertility.

Brown: reliable, boredom, practical.

White: purity, innocence, empty, spacious.

Black: evil, death, mourning, slimming.

Yellow: bright, gives you energy, been show to make babies cry, causes eye fatigue.

Orange: excitement, enthusiasm.

Lavender: calms the nerves.

Purple: royalty, wealth.

Pink: feminine, calming.
Roles of Symbols

Mr. Clean = strong man for cleaning shit.

Wells Fargo horses = independence, Wild West.

Symbols can be dated, though.
Slogans/Taglines

Can remove some of the ambiguity associated with brand and/or symbol.

Can generate its own equity/emotion (“reach out and touch someone”).

Tagline basics: Must be short. Must be differentiated from competition. Cannot have any negative connotations. Can be protected and trademarked. Must evoke an emotional response.
Types

Imperative: “Just do it”, “Invent”, “Think Different”

Descriptive: “Moving at the Speed of Business” UPS), “Bullish on America” (Merrill Lynch), “You’re in Good Hands” (Allstate)

Superlative: “The Ultimate Driving Machine” (BMW), “There’s No Better Way to Fly” (Lufthansa)

Provocative: “Got Milk?” (Dairy Council)

Clever: “Drivers Wanted” (VW)
3.4: Packaging

1930s packaging research started when self-service supermarkets started becoming more popular. When consumers started to bring stuff, they realized that packaging is important.

People preferred detergent that was in the box with circles rather than triangles. They preferred the packages with the circles (and that the detergent was better) even though they were exactly the same. (Tide still has circles).

Packaging can influence at the point of purchase and it can have a continuing influence at the point of consumption.

Multiple objectives

Identify

Present information

Protect and allow transportation

Storage

Aid consumption

In a sea of competing messages, the package has to grab consumers’ attention. But it has to work so that customers can buy again.
Examples

Calvin Klein: Need to be seen as edgy (it was a unisex one). People aren’t exactly experts when they choose fragrances so packaging is very, very important.

Absolut: Iconic bottle shape, it was hard to use for bartenders because the neck was short. But it was something to remember.

Coca-Cola: Very distinctive shape. When the bottle went from glass to plastic, they really wanted to recreate their shape in plastic.

Heinz: The shape actually makes it hard to get the ketchup out of it.

3.5: Brand Elements: Persuasion

Persuasion: an active attempt to change belief and attitude. EXTREMELY HARD because people aren’t scientific about it.
Central Route to Persuasion

If people are motivated and they are highly involved and if they have the opportunity and the ability to process marketing messages, then the way to persuade them is through central cues and arguments.
Peripheral Route to Persuasion

When motivation, opportunity, ability, and elaboration likelihoods are low, then just focus on peripheral cues.

Peripheral Cues: People think of these heuristically.

Classical conditioning: Persuade people by putting things together all the time. Ex: Coke + Big Mac.

Reciprocity: You owe me.

Consistency: We’ve always done it that way.

Social Proof: Everybody’s doing it.

Liking: Love me, then love my ideas. Not rational but makes sense.

Authority: Just because I say so.

Scarcity: Quick, before they’re all gone.
What makes a good celebrity endorser?

Central processing: The person is an expert so there is information there.

Peripheral: Because the celebrity is attractive or likeable.

Considerations: Celebrity/audience fit, celebrity/brand fit, celebrity attractiveness, practical (cost, celebrity exposure, risk, etc.)

Social network, celebrity should have followers.

High Q-rating: “How appealing is this celebrity among those who do know him/her?”, ratio of popularity/familiarity.

Transfer of meaning: Celebrities are charged with detailed and powrful meanings. An ad firm chooses a celebrity that best represents the appropriate symbolic properties of the product.

fMRI scans show that there is more brain activation when presented with images of celebrities: a visceral reaction to celebrity.
Ex: Tiger Woods

Source models/source credibility: Effectiveness depends on celebrity’s “expertness” and “trustworthiness”.

Source attractiveness: familiar, likable, similarity.
Modes of Usage

Explicit: I endorse this product.

Implicit: I use this product.

Imperative: You should use this product.

Co-present: Celebrity appears with product.
3.6: Repositioning a Brand
5 Rationales for Brand Change

The identity/execution was poorly conceived.

Perfect positioning, but the target for the identity is limited. Need to change to reach a broader market.

The identity has become out of date.

The identity has lost its edge and it becomes old-fashioned. Their position which was once contemporary has become less so.

Same over time becomes boring to consumers, losing ability to attract attention.
Consistency!

Most brands, when they reposition, need to be close to the old one, so people can make the connection again.

Ex: Cognitive inconsistency for smoking. People rationalize to make the chain of “me-smoking-death” to allow themselves to smoke.

“I don’t think smoking is unhealthy.” “I only smoke sometimes.” “I can’t live forever, anyway.”

Everyone makes rationalizations to make sure that they are always right!
Ex: Oldsmobile

The association between Oldsmobile and “dad’s car” was bad. So they wanted to make a new ad saying that it was exciting.

The problem was that there is a big cognitive dissonance so it didn’t work.

It is next to impossible to reposition because the car literally has old in the name.
Evolving Brand Associations

A brand can evolve more gradually to gain more contemporary associations while maintaining familiarity.

Update symbols, brand names, slogans, and new products.


Butterfly effect: Just jump out, to keep things modern and new and fresh. The idea of freshness is enough to make it buyable.


No more hamburgers since it is more than Wendy’s. The redhead is no longer trapped inside the circle. The typeface is newer.
Changing Brand Names to Eliminate Constraints

Boston Chicken to Boston Market.

Weather Channel to Weather Companies.

Starbucks to Just their Image.
Example: BMW

Before: Expensive, German, Baby Boomers.

Change: Design of the cars, sunglasses, high-performance bikes, golf tournaments.
Major Points

Consistency over time is very valuable in building strong brands.

All brand elements should work in harmony to communicate brand identity.

Change is sometimes necessary–but be cautious!

Begin by understanding sources of equity and the currenty contributions to POP and POD, strength, favorability and uniqueness.







## 5.1: From Product-Centric to Customer Centric

#### Review of 3 Axes

* Performance Superiority: Best Product
* Operational Excellence: Keep the cost low.
* Customer Intimacy: How do we get more money on something that actually adds cost?

#### The Product-Centric Approach

For most companies, it's all about making money and maximizing the _net present value_ of the corporation.

The two non-customer centric axes aim to get *high volume* (performance superiority), *low cost* (operational excellence). Just ask yourself, will your company scale? Are costs coming down as you deliver more and more of the product?

Market Share: A good indicator of how well you've done, and how well you'll be doing in the future.

Growth: It's not enough to just be doing things effectively, shareholders want to see more and want to see growth. 

You can choose to take your product and bring it to new customers. You can also choose to innovate and get new products and new services or extensions to the current products.

So regardless of how you build things, you want to grow the product, and companies are structured around each of the company's products (product managers, brand managers).

The competitive advantage: *product expertise* (we are better than everyone else).

* Goal: Best product for customer.
* Main offering: New products.
* Value creation roue: Cutting-edge products, useful features, new applications.
* Pricing: Price to market.
* Structure of organization: Product profit centers, product reviews, and product teams
* Measures/metrics: Number of new products, percentage of revenue from products less than 2 years old, market share
* People
	* Approach to personnel: Power to the people who develop products. Manage creative people through challenges and a deadline.
	* Mental process: *Divergent thinking.* How many possible uses of this product? We hire people that can think divergently and who can spread the market.
	* Sales bias: On the side of the seller in a transaction
	* Culture: New product culture, open to new ideas and experimentation.

## 5.2 Cracks in the Product-Centric Approach

There are things going on today that weren't happening 15-20 years ago that are causing the product-centric approach a little bit different.

* *Technology-enabled product development (commoditization):* With technology, things commoditize much more quickly. Companies know that as they launch something new, they have to think of the next product already. In the natural world, every company wants or it thinking monopoly.
* *Technology-eneabled information flow (smart customers):* Customers are smarter and more savvy so they are aware of more things available to them. It's harder for companies to extract value for the products they deliver.
* *Technology-enabled delivery (retail saturation):* In the olden days, companies could rely on the fact that no one else had a product like that, or customers won't be aware of other products, or customers won't have access to other products. It's harder to protect yourself from other competing products.
* *Globalization*
* *Deregulation:* As industries deregulate/fewer monopoly, companies have to stay competitive.
* Customers want *"end to end solutions"*, which may require products/services from multiple vendors.
* Information systems enable *customer data tracking*. Companies have to use the data about their customers to figure out what they're buying.

Example: IBM was very product-centric, but in the 1990s, they learned they can be better as an advisor, but they're making money telling the customer "here's what you should buy".

## 5.3-5.4: Data-Driven Business Models/Direct Marketing

_Harrahs_ had a difficult time competing with companies with more resources. Their rewards program was able to get more data from the customer than other companies. They were able to provide better messages at the right time.

_Tesco_ turned to the data, too. They understood what households bought from them, and what products those households bought. So Tesco knew which customers were most liable to switch to Walmart, and they were able to defend themselves.

The first businesses to be customer-centric were direct marketing companies. Although it has a negative connotation, it's about knowing who your customers are and what they buy, exactly. Stuff such as segmentation and customer lifetime value come from direct marketers. Once we understood which customers are valuable, we can understand where to focus or products on.

Any company that operates on the Internet and can track the customer over time can be a direct marketer.

## 5.5: Which Firms are Customer Centric?

Which of Walmart, Apple, Starbucks, and Nordstrom are customer-centric?

In his book, not one of them are customer-centric.

* *Walmart:* Terrific firm, but doesn't know anything about the customers. It does not have a loyalty program. They make efforts to understand customers as a whole, not customers individually. Walmart isn't a direct marketing firm, it is about selling products at volume and low cost. They are a product-centric firm.
* *Apple:* They are the classic superiority firm. They aren't focused on segmentation, but they are focused on leveraging their product expertise.
* *Starbucks:* At a local level, they are very customer-centric. The barista knows a lot about you if you are a constant customer (through your casual conversations). They are not customer centric at a national level, if you bring your Starbucks card to another place, they don't know who you are. A truly customer-centric company will provide value wherever you go.
* *Nordstrom:* They sell apparrel. When someone returned tires that they didn't buy at Nordstrom (it doesn't even sell tires), Nordstrom returned the money. This doesn't make sense, but if the customer is expected to have a ton of future value, then you could, and most probably should, give them money lol. Nordstrom treats everyone incredibly well which is sort of a problem because they are missing opportunities on which customers to choose.

Improvements of the companies: Walmart is developing new products to improve themselves on the customer-centric initiative: the scanner app to know what the customers are buying. Apple also is tracking customer data via iTunes music preferences.

## 6.1: What is Customer Centricity

*Customer centricity* is a strategy that aligns a company's development/delivery of its products/services around the current and future needs of a *select set of customers* in order to maximize their long-term financial value to the firm.

* _Select set of customers:_ If we are a product-centric firm, it's hard to keep our costs down if we have a select set of customers only.
* _Maximizing their long-term financial value:_ We want to invest in the right amount of customers. Instead of asking a customer to buy things right now, we wait for the long-term benefit.
* _Aligns a company's development and delivery to customers:_ "Here are our really valuable cx, let's come up with something for them! R&D folks, come up with something for them." Fact is, these customers are valuable because they like our products.

Customer centricity requires the company to be willing and able to change its *organizational design*, *performance metrics*, and *employee/distributor incentive structures* to focus on this long-run value creation/delivery process.

We look not at what customers have been valuable, but what customers will be valuable.

Sales of the month people are backward-looking. You're incentivizing people to rush sales in order to get their bonuses. Ideally, we'd like the company lifetime value of each customer. We want to not check how much a customer bought. We want to see how much we've improved their value, or how far we took the relationship.

If airlines would be really forward-looking, they'd realize that MBA students would take a temporary hit on their travel, but after that hit, they'd travel even more!

## 6.2/6.3: Living in a Customer-Centric World/More Reflections on Customer Centricity

Remember the over-arching objective: to maximize shareholder value. Remember though that we can't just rely on product-centricity to get more money.

What we celebrate is *customer heterogeneity:* distinguish the profitable customers from the less profitable ones.

While at first it was a nuisance, with time we realize that customers are really, really different from each other.

Understand that success arises through enhanced customer acquisition, retention, and development.

As we start figuring out which customers have to be kept, and which customers can be better customers, and which customers can be let go.

P&G: Their customer is the retailer right now, but they understand that at some point, their customers will be us. In their "My Black is Beautiful" campaign, they are trying to position themselves as a trusted advisor (music, a specific product line, Queen Latifah).

We want to have relationship expertise!

Re: Finding the right customers. Understand that customer centricity does NOT suggest that "non-focal" customers should be ignored, to the contrary, it is important to have a health proportion of such customers to add a high degree of stability and robustness to the overall customer base.

There is a *paradox of customer centricity:* the more that a firm tightens its central focus on a select group of customers, the more it needs its "non-focal" customers to stabilize the overall mix.

## 6.4: Questions on Customer Centricity

*Who is the customer?* In pharmacy, you can argue that the person, the hospital, or the insurance is the customer. We want to agree that one of these entities is the customer, but one customer matters more than others.

*What are the major barriers to account for?* There might be logistics or cultural reasons.

*What resources can you utilize to preempt the barriers?*

*Thoughts about what competitiors are doing in this area?* In many cases, the best case to move this is "hey, no one is doing this, let's do it!"

Does it make sense for your organization to become customer centric? If so, when?

## 7.1: How Can Customer Centricity Be Profitable?

The traditional product-centric model is showing some cracks: commoditization, well-informed customers, globalization, etc.

Cx centricity celebrates cx heterogeneity: we celebrate the differences of cx. We judge cx based on what they are worth to us.

We have to beg good in: customer acquisition, retention , and development. The common split is: 5% acquisition, 47% retention, and 47% development.

#### Customer Acquisition

_What metric is used by most firms to gauge and guide their acquisition activities?_

*CPA (cost per acquisition).* It's very easy to track nowadays. But focusing your business to use this as your main metric is a *big mistake*.

We want to think of our customers as assets, and they are the most important assets that we have. When it comes to other assets, such as lawyers or technology, we use the mentality of not the best, but the skill.

What we want is *value per acquisition*. We think of the upside of each custoemr, and we used that to drive CPA.

People should use the CLV (customer lifetime value) as a seal on the maximum amount you spend to get a customer. With this, we can allocate how much profit we could build to our stakeholders. We want to not spend a ton more, but we want to get more valuable customers.

Customers acquired through Google on average have a higher lifetime value (mean $1K) than cx acquired through different channels. Instead of penny pinching per customer and per click, we shoudld orient ourselves to the value rather than the cost (the difference is so high anyway).

##### Customer Acquisition Summary
- Don't be in a CPA mentality (focus on ceilings instead of floors).
- Celebrate heterogeneity by using CLV to drive acquisition strategies.

## 7.2 Customer Retention

_What metric is used by most firms to gauge and guide their acquisition activities?_

*Churn/attrition rate (retention rate). What percent of our customers stayed with us?*

This is a good metric, but you need to examine it at a closer level. How do companies manage their attrition rates? Ex: Vodafone. Their attrition rate is roughly 20%. This means that we expect the customer lifetime to be 5 years. We multiply this by the number of customers and the number of profits per customer to get the customer equity. 

It's not enough to see the customer, we need to check each of them if they are churn-prone or not.

Customers in usually any subscription group: 60% 0.05 attrition, 30% 0.4 attrition rate, 10% 0.7 attrition. The 60%, don't just assume that they are loyal, maybe they are just indifferent to the service or lazy.

How to make an informed assessment on what a customers is worth?

	Cluster  	 Attrition	 % Customers
	Low risk 	 0.06 	 	 70
	Medium Risk	 0.35 		 20
	High Risk 	 0.65 		 10

Average attrition: (0.06 * 0.7 + 0.35 * 0.2 + 0.65 + 0.1) = 0.17ish or *5.6 years*. *But this is still wrong because there is no average customer.* No customer exists with that number! We eliminated heterogeneity.

Reichelt's The Loyalty Effect: "Because we can't get accurate calculations with averages, we must work with the actual reates for each separate class of customers." So what you do is make clusters of results.

	Cluster  	 Attrition	 % Cx	Expected Lifetime (!!!)
	Low risk 	 0.06 	 	 70		16.7
	Medium Risk	 0.35 		 20		2.9
	High Risk 	 0.65 		 10		1.5	

Correct average lifetime: (16.7 * 0.7 + 2.9 * 0.2 + 1.5 * 0.1) = *12.4 years*.

Whenever there is any heterogeneity at all, there will always be money left on the table, if we ignore heterogeneity. The only question is, how much? So it's not a question of whether it will occur or not because it will always occurs, you just have to figure out how much.

#### Customer Retention Summary
- There is not "average customer", and calculations on such a notion will always underestimate the value of a cx base.
- When heterogeneity is accounted for, the "attrition elasticity" is much lower than in the heterogenous case. Investments in reducing attrition are more modest that what you think you are. Some customers will leave at some point. Sometimes it's just better to look for new customers rather than retaining old ones.

## 7.3-7.4 Customer Development

*Efforts to increase the profitability of current customers.*

- Cross-selling. "Do you want fries with that?"
- Up-selling. "Do you want to super-size it?"
- Increase frequency.
- Premium pricing and charge different prices. (Bundle with special services.)

_What metric is used by most firms to gauge and guide their acquisition activities?_

*Share of wallet.* How many of the cx's needs are met by the firm. Ex: Wells Fargo, they are focused on services/cx. But we also need to take into consideration *size of wallet*. Remember: if a cx has small income, then they will have a very huge size of wallet (You can't really buy much so you just buy from a few companies.)

There is no systematic relationship between size of wallet and share of wallet. While we want to develop our cx, if we want to make our cx more valuable to us, there isn't necessarily a good relationship for CLV.

Good news: "Cx with high share in one category also tend to have high share in another category, indicating that cx share decisions are positively correlated."

Bad news: Some cx are just "take it or leave it, they won't necessarily give you good business even if you push the cx dev in their faces (I can relate lol)."

- It is useful to look for development opportunities, but the upside to these activities is more limited than more managers think.
- Due to massive cx heterogeneity, there is more opportunity to move the needle via acquisition, rather than development.
- Cx development is more about "icing on the cake" rather than super super important.

#### Favor acquisition, especially at the start. 
- If you are in a saturated market, you want to favor retention!
- Consider the conventional wisdom: "It costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain one, so work hard to keep the ones you have..." While this may be true, but it totally misses the point: maybe we will get more value if we acquire the cx that are actually more valuable rather than if we retain the meh customers.
- The better cx will naturally stick longer, and you'll see the gains from the investment.

#### Overall Summary
- Customer centricity can only succeed by "celebrating heterogeneity."
- The greatest upside to improve customer profitability arises through "smart acquisition."
- Don't overspend on retention-the flighty customers will fly away, no matter what you do (or they'll be unprofitable).
- *Most of all, check out CLV!*

## 7.5: Wrap-up

To make cx centricity profitable, then you have to calculate/update individual cx value. We need to be able to do this on a regular basis.

It's very tempting to get to send each cx a personalized message, but why not break cx into segments based on relevant characteristics. Figure out which segments have a good CLV.

Super important: Constant experimentation. Important cx: "wells". Understand the various characterstics of cx that will be valuable.

Repeat these on a regular basis! Do a lot of things and experiments to know what it is to be cx-centric.

Remember: Cx-centric is not cx service. Super targetting is not very good at all. We want to be choosy on which cx we need to focus on. Don't intrude their privacy.

Don't forget about the paradox, that even a cx-centric organization will do these cx-centric things for a few cx only. Most cx, you want their business, but not a super deep relationship. If cx-centricity is going to succeed, then we have to sort out the good cx from the not so good cx.

If we're really going to do the cx strategy, then we have to be long-term. If you're investing in cx, then you actually have to lose money in the short run, to gain in the long run.

## 8.2: Go To Market Strategies: Introduction

#### Marketing Acronyms
- Constraints:
	- Customers (Needs)
	- Competitors (Relative strength)
	- Company (Resources)
	- Collaborators (Partners)
	- Context (Change)
- Parameters
	- Product
	- Price
	- Promotion
	- Place
- Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning (STP)

#### Marketing. The product should:
- Deliver exceptional value.
- Address large market.
- Be easy to explain and describe.
- Not require much capital to test and scale.

#### Execution: The Key Question

*"What's wrong with the status quo?"* What can be improved about the current experience of doing things?

Ex: Starbucks, Schultz discovered that Americans loved to drink coffee, but they were not good coffee. In Europe, people drank in coffee shops. When he came back to the U.S., he had in his mind thought of Starbucks as a "third place" (first place being home and second place being workplace).

#### Four Unstoppable Trends that Affect New Businesses
- Democratization in access (www.coursera.org). Technology, through scale and low-cost has allowed people to allow access to what people need to do.
- Value chain disruption (www.harrys.org).
- Collaborative consumption (www.zipcar.com). There is an oversupply of product.
- Matching of supply and demand (www.uber.com).

#### Marketing Math 101

*Success = Product * Marketing*

Marketing = Customer/Brand Fit and the other 3Ps (price, promotion, place, distribution strategy).

## 8.3/8.4/8.5: Friction/Goods and Information/Academic Research

#### What frictions does the real world have that the digital world solves?
- *Search Friction.* Where do you buy a TV? Who will have the best price and assortment? In 1987, to get better prices and deals, you have to go out and incur costs by looking for other stores. In 2011, you just go to a website and check things out. Ex: Yelp.
- *Geographic Friction.* The location that you live in imposes certain costs and delivers particular benefits (NY vs. Iowa). E-commerce etc. reduces the friction of stuff.

#### Goods and Information

Prior to the Internet, all markets were "local". The Internet allows businesses to pool customers.

The Internet allows businesses to pool customers. In smaller markets the Internet is great for access to goods that you can't get locally. In larger markets, the Internet is great for giving us information that helps us figure out how to spend our time.

#### Academic Research

A lot of content delivered by the Internet is purely local (local services, restaurants, people to date).

Research shows that for every additional 1 million residents in a town there are at least 50-60 additional sites devoted to local content.

The further you live from a single physical store; the less likely you are to visit it. (Logical.)

#### Benefits Delivered by Online World
- Potentially lower prices/lower search costs.
- You can transact with other more efficiently.
- Better infromation about local activities.
- Improved consumer convenience (shopping can be done at any time).

90% are still bought offline. 1% of the groceries are bought online.

#### Frictions
- Delivery times.
- Uncertainty about "fit and feel" of certain products.
- Cost of returns (time and money).

Expect the two worlds (online and offline) to coexist for a very long time.

Online/Offline Competition: Competition is intense for popular products, but almost non-existent for niche products. Ex: People will buy Harry Potter in a real-world store, but not for niche products like 100 Years of Black Trivia.

## 8.7/8.8: The Long Tail

The Internet makes it possible for products to exist in the long tail.

Historically, we lived in a world of "hits/blockbusters", but now live in a world of infinite slots.

The economics of distribution have been altered that we can offer much more variety than ever before.

Supply side: Sellers can offer a lot more variety.

Demand side: The Long Tail is endogenous as there are more ways for us to discover variety.

#### Key Principles

*The tyranny of locality:* What you buy is detailed by your local stores. An audience that is spread too thin geographically used to not get served. As you go from the head to the tail, the average satisfaction suffers, but there are products in the long tail which you would definitely like.

The ratio of niche products to "hits" is changing.

Distribution efficiency is amplifying.

Recommendations and reviews drive search so that consumers get into the tail.

MIT study obtained darta from a retailer offering identical product selection and prices through two different channels: Internet and catalog.

Descriptive evidence is that Internet sales are significantly less concentrated (even after controlling after differences in factors).

The Internet channel has more evenly distributed sales and the difference cannot be attributed to differences in price or availability. Online: Long tail. Offline: 80-20.

	Niche products: 14.8% vs. 12.7%.
	$ sales of niche: 15.0% vs. 12.7%.

The question is whether there is a demand side explanation.

Key variables to explain sales of niche products:

- Directed search.
- Non-directed search.
- Recommender system.

The sales of an Internet retailer also spread out geographically. We start first in NY/LA/Chicago.

#### Critiques
- Law of natural monopoly/hit effect: Hits get attention of light users.
- Double Jeopardy: Unfamiliar things are less liked.

## 8.9: How Internet Retailing Startups Grow

Netgrocer.com, diapers.com, warbyparkers.com, bonobos.com, citruslane.com

#### Research Question: Why do some locations have more customers than other locations do?
- Internet retailers can alter the cost-benefit trade-off shoppers by making things "closer" and more accessible perhaps even at better places.
- *Sales evolution is structured and predictable.* In 3 1/2 years, Netgrocer was able to have customers from 18,000 zip codes. *Sales pop up around places with sales near it.* Customers could be talking to each other, or observing each other (that's why boxes are colorful).
- Social distance: If you're in Chicago, you might interact more with someone from L.A. as opposed to Springfield even though it is farther.
	- In the beginning, sales start out in larger cities and spread by proximity from person to person.
	- Later on, sales pick up in smaller areas with people who have the same characteristics.

## 8 (Readings) [Amazon Fresh is Jeff Bezos' Last Mile Quest...](http://www.fastcompany.com/3014817/amazon-jeff-bezos)

Amazon is 5% of the volume of the $1T e-commerce sales.

Some features: "1-Click Ordering" for impulse buying, "Subscribe & Save" for replenishment of essentials, "Amazon Lockers" for secure pick-up. But the strongest is _speed*. Amazon Prime, second-day delivery is "losing money on shipping/services in exchange for loyalty." 10M prime members spend $1224/year on A, over $700 more than a regular ruser.

## 8 (Readings) [Welcome To The Unicorn Club: Learning From Billion-Dollar Startups](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/)

Historically, top venture funds have driven returns from their ownership in just a few companies in a given fund of many companies.

#### Learnings

1. Approx 60,000 software/Internet companies were funded in the last decade. So 0.07 percent have become unicorns, 1 in 1538.

2. On average, four unicorns were born per year in the past decade, with Facebook being the breakout "super-unicorn" (worth >$100 billion and it accounts for half of the $260B value of the companies). In each recent decade, 1-3 super unicorns have been born. Each decade has a super-unicorn: 90s-Google, 80s-Cisco, 70s-Apple, Oracle, Microsoft, 60s-Intel.

3. Consumer-oriented companies have created the majority of value in the past decade: FB, Google, Amazon.

4. The average enterprise-oriented unicorn raised $138M, and they are currently worth 26x their private capital (more than consumer-oriented).

5. Business models: Consumer e-commerce, consumer audience, SaaS, enterprise software.
	- E-commerce: Consumer pays for goods or services. Nobody holds physical inventory.
	- Audience: Monetization through ads or leads.
	- SaaS: Fremium for cloud-based software.
	- Enterprise: Companies pay for larger scale software.
	- *Network effects.* These help companies scale users dramatically, seriously reducing capital requirements, and/or increasing valuations quickly.

6. Seven-plus years on average before liquidity for companies.

7. Companies with well-educated, thirtysomething co-founders who have history together have built the most successes.
	- Average age of founders: *34*. Ninety-percent of co-founding teams have years of history together, from school or work.
	- Nearly 80% of unicorns have at least one co-founder that founded a company before.
	- Only 3 did not have a technical co-founder on board.

## 9.1: Brands and Digital Marketing

"Digital marketing... is the use of Internet connected devices to engage a cx." 

#### Elements of Digital Marketing
- *Social Commerce:* We rely on reviews, blogs, and networks of creators influence what we buy. We get reviews from friends and strangers before we buy shit.
- *Digital Advertising and Behavioral Targeting:* Big data, micro-level targeting.
- *Experimentation and A/B Testing:* More experiments get run than ever before. Ex: Red website and flames make people want to choose vehicles with high safety. Green website make people want to choose vehicles with value for money.

#### Brand assets

Intangible assets now account for about 50% of all assets for non-financial businessses (only 20% in 1950). Google is powerful because of its intellectual capital.

About one third of the value in global stock markets is attributable to "brands."

The top global brands outperform the market; majority of the top twenty stocks have strong brands.

1964: In cups: people discerned the taste of Guinness, whereas Budweiser/Pabst/Miller Lite/Colt 45/Coors were perceived to be the same. In bottles: different.

Top brands: Apple, Google, Coca-Cola, IBM, Microsoft, GE, McDonalds, Samsung, Intel, Toyota, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Cisco, Disney, HP, Gillette, Louis Vuitton, Oracle, Amazon, Honda, H&M, Pepsi, Amex, Nike, SAP, Ikea, UPS, Ebay.

Quidsi: Diapers.com, Soap.com, Beautybar.com...

#### Goals and Tactics

*Brand goals:* "Heart and mind, thinking and feeling." Ex: Dear Sophie, using people's preferences of white meat to frame pork as white rather than red, Got Milk? campaign.

*Key tactic:* Build engagement through real world events that can be leveraged up in the virtual world.

#### Digital Considerations
1. Outstanding value proposition
2. Authenticity and transparency
3. Brand personality and humanization
4. "Infinite" life and potential for serendipity

JetBlue All You Can Jet ("JetBlue Cheeps") promoted via Twitter. Sold out in a week, 10m blog references, 31m searches. 29 in 29 days, generated a tremendous lift in the campaign for JetBlue.

Negative: #McDStories.

Celebrities to endorse brands: If there is a mismatch between the personality and the branding, then it's hard to trust.

"Organic Celebrity", Ree Drummond.

## 9.2: Customers and Digital Marketing

Goals: Attract, engage, retain subject to:

1. Never pay more to acquire than you will recoup...!
2. CLV needs to incorporate the "RLV", or referral lifetime value. The first 100K cx of diapers.com had a $1 coupon. 8% of them participated in referrals. The number they produced was about 32K cx. *But actually, the top 100 cx generated 15K additional cx!*
3. Change from monologoue to conversation via repeated conversations. How can we use technology to engage with cx?
4. Selection and treatment. Cx attracted through word of mouth have high referral values. If a cx was acquired through referral, then their referral rate is about 15-18%.

## 9.3: Reviews

\>60% of users read reviews before making a purchase and positive reviews before making a purchase and positive reviews increase conversion rates.

TripAdvisor, a site that aggregates reviews from other websites raised $4.2M in venture capital, was sold to Expedia for $210M, and is capped at $3.5B. It puts information into the market, with information contributed by you and I.

Theory: More information to consumers is almost always better. In addition, when info is provided by firms, it might affect their behavior as well.

Los Angeles health inspectors put signs on restaurants signifying their health ratings. Sales at restaurants with an A went up 5.7%, B went up 0.1%, and C went down 1%. But everyone increased their quality. Hospital admissions went down in LA, but not in the rest of CA.

So we know that reviews change behavior. But these should be objective and reliable.

At Amazon and Barnes & Noble, people are generous (4.14 average at A and 4.45 at BN). One star reviews are rare (7%, 3%) and five-star reviews are abundant (57%, 67%). Amazon reviews are longer.

The negative effect of a one-star review \> positive effect of a five-star review. People read review text!

Data-mining expert, Bing Lui: "About one in three online reviews are fake." TripAdvisor is less reliable than Expedia because Expedia requires you to have actually stayed (credit card) to review.

## 9.4: Product Life Cycle (I know this na)

## 9.5: Influence and How Information Spreads

#### Elements of Networks

_"Pathways through which information, advice, resources, and support flow between people."_ (Aral 2012)

Networks show homophily ("Birds of a feather flock together"). Your friends are probably like you.

A "network" needs nodes (people), connections (between people), ability to share information and resources, constraints.

*Entering a network is a choice*, and we also decide how many people we want to connect to and how central we want to be. When our relationships are transitive, then we are deeply embedded.

When influence happens, it doesn't have to happen by conversations. People can be influenced by seeing what people are doing. Even "strangers" and loose connections in a network can connect us. 1 person = 4% looked up, 15 people = 40%. Other thingie: 6 degrees of separation.

*Connection doesn't necessarily mean influence.* Influence spreading out from you will typically not move more than 3 steps.

## 9.6: Elements of Neighborhoods and Examples

Unit of analysis = person, zip code, city block, or virtual neighborhood.

When you know who is connected to who and whom, you'll know who influences who.

How do we know how people spread? Well people who are already close together transfer information between each other. Then, the packaging is important, so people can see where people got from. Lastly, the place where you bought the thing, if it was shipped to your house or to your office.

Even after adjusting for demographics which affect online purchases (education, access to computer), the statistical effect had a huge economic impact: neighbors using the product increased the chance of you using the product itself.

## 9.7-9.8: Other Examples of Influence

Connections: While we may have numerous "friends", only a fraction carry influence. The meaning of "friends" changes.

Scale problem: Because there are lots of friends and links, inferring who is influential for whom is difficult.

Goal: Influence-based targetting.

If a member increase usage and connected others do too, the member is "influential." If a member increases usage or decreases usage and there is no change in the behavior of connected others, the user is not influential.

*Findings: On average, you are influenced by 1/5 of your friends and the other 4/5 don't sway you. And 1/3 of users were not influenced by anyone.*

There are many people whose influence factor is close to 0, but there is a smaller number of people whose influence is so big.

#### Factors
- Longer member statistically more influential.
- Ethnicity/country
- Girls were influential over guys, not the converse.
- If you're indicating that you're looking to date other people, that significantly decreases your influence.

#### Implications
- *Simple metrics:* Friend counts and profiel views are inadequate proxies for influence.
- *Retention:* If top losers defect, there is a disproportionate negative effect on the network.
- *Advantage:* Most of the payoff from the model comes from superior identification of the "best" cx.

Physician to physician medical research findings: We see who is connected to whom, and by how much. A drug company would prefer to know the influential doctors. A self-reported rating of influence is not a very strong indicator.  What's more important to know are people's recognition of who is influential and not.

The firm found that it was helpful to understand the "network structure" as "unexpected leaders" emerged. These were doctors which other doctors referred to in scientific reporting. (Once again doctors with the same ethnicity were influential to each other.)

Bonobos.com: If I see Chris wearing Bonobo jeans, would I buy from bonobos.com?

Social capital ("Bowling Alone"). How connected are people to each other in the neighborhood?

#### The conditions:

- Apparrel has non-digital attributes. It's hard to communicate how it fits and feels over the Internet. (As opposed to buying soap where you knew what you were going to get.)

- Focus on new trials - we want to get cx which haven't bought from the website.

- The product has to be socially visible. It can generate social conversation.

Neighborhoods with more social capital shared better. But actually, some became cx because people in the same neighborhood had used it. At least half were influenced by social learning: cx became cx because someone in their local neighborhood told them about it. And the cx who came later on were the once who were most influenced by social interaction (they rely on the opinions of others).

In neighborhoods where there are more trust and interaction, there's not necessarily more sales. But when info is transmitted, it's more trusted.

It turns out that the number of bars per capita were a good metric to know the efficiency of diffusion of information in the 20-45 male group.

## 9 (Readings) [Crossing the New Chasm: Focusing on Addiction, Not Just Adoption](http://allthingsd.com/20130418/crossing-the-new-chasm-focusing-on-addiction-not-just-adoption/)

"It is easier than ever to start a company, but harder than ever to make it durable."

To build companies that last, entrepreneurs must deliver a product in a way that translates into “addictive” retention. Early adoption is not enough. Any successful product needs habit-forming attributes that compel customers to return hourly, daily, weekly or monthly.

#### Building Blocks for Engagement

- *A founder who is obsessed with customer experience.* A successful startup needs a founder who wants to over-deliver on UX, no matter what. It needs a founder who is focused on consumer delight and product quality, and also cares about the details.

- *A product that is highly habit-forming.* Companies that build products that are engaging from the start and draw repeat visitors help to create a consumer mind-set that leads to habitual use. Making a business engaging means drawing users in. Tap into consumer desires and celebrate the aspirational aspect of a site. 

- *A focus on network effects or brands.* Businesses that build a brand that stands for something specific or that have network effects tend to become much more durable. Skype, Lending Club and Airbnb are great examples of network-effect businesses; more demand brings supply, and more supply brings demand.

- *Gamification and engagement mechanics.* Ensuring traction for your site means getting consumers addicted in such a way that they return again and again.

## 9 (Readings) [The Neighborhood Effect](http://chronicle.com/article/the-neighborhood-effect/135492/)

"Families that moved to safer and better-off areas "improved their health in ways that were quite profound. They showed less depression and very large increases in happiness." - Lawrence F. Katz. yet the program failed to improve other key measures, like the earnings and employment rate of adults and the educational achievement of children.

Among his many findings, Sampson shows that exposure to severely disadvantaged areas hampers children's verbal skills, an effect that persists even if they move to better-off places. That handicap is "roughly equivalent to missing a year of schooling."

Sharkey, an associate professor of sociology at New York University, writes that "over 70 percent of African-Americans who live in today's poorest, most racially segregated neighborhoods are from the same families that lived in the ghettos of the 1970s."

The Truly Disadvantaged told a different tale. It explained the rise of "a new type of urban poverty," as Sharkey calls it. Wilson described how the erosion of manufacturing drove up joblessness. Cities transformed from "centers of goods processing to centers of information processing." Their growth industries required workers with more education. And the jobs that required less learning were sprouting up in suburbs and exurbs, according to one study cited by Wilson, "far removed from growing concentrations of poorly educated urban minorities."

Wilson also stressed a social shift: the desertion of inner-city neighborhoods by working- and middle-class black families. Their exodus weakened a "social buffer" that could "deflect the full impact" of economic hardship, he argued. It eroded local institutions like churches, schools, and stores. And it removed "mainstream role models" who could reinforce the value of education, work, and family.

The result "was a concentration of poverty in the urban ghetto that was associated with an array of social problems, including violence, homelessness, joblessness, rising rates of families headed by single women, and welfare receipt," as Sharkey summarizes it in his book. "Whereas the ghetto of the 1940s was a place where all classes of African-American families were forced to live, the ghetto of the 1980s was a place where the most impoverished African-Americans had been abandoned."

To understand human development, you have to understand the contexts that affect it. Sampson argues that neighborhood environments—not just the characteristics of people living in them—influence phenomena like crime, health, and learning. "In fact, the world is very clumpy," he says. "And it's very unequal."

One concept key to Sampson's thinking is "collective efficacy," a measure of how much people trust their neighbors and are willing to help them. "It turns out that in some neighborhoods, people believe it's kind of a no man's land," Sampson says. "They don't trust their neighbors at all."

"That finding challenged nearly three decades of conventional wisdom that tied poverty and physical disorder to heightened crime," writes Venkatesh, an expert on gang life. "No longer could we simply clean up the streets to get rid of the criminal element. We needed to promote, well, neighborliness."

Sampson also contradicts the stereotype that a concentration of immigrants drives up crime. In reality, immigrants appear to be "less violent than people born in America, particularly when they live in neighborhoods with high numbers of other immigrants," he has written. Immigrants born outside the United States were 45 percent less likely to commit violence than third-generation Americans, while second-generation immigrants were 22 percent less likely.

## 9: Pricing Strategies 1: Introduction

Over 2,000 companies surveyed. If they improve by 1%... then gain 2.3% on fixed costs, 3.3% on volumen, 7.8% on variable costs, and *11.1% on price*.

Pricing Puzzles

- Trader Joes: They sell dumplings for $3.99 and we have know idea if this is a good deal or not. What they do is they price water at very low prices so this gives them a lower price as a comparison measure.
- Walmart: Why does W sell Tide at $4.73: They send the message that they squeeze out every cent to decrease the value for the consumer.
- Catalog: More shoes were sold at $49 than at $44. $44 is "a weird price, that is 10% more than 40" and $49 is "a price that is discounted."


#### Price Factors

- Floor
- Ceiling
- Competition: Drops the ceiling.
- The amount that prices have to be raised to motivate the sellers.

Cx, company, collaborators

Company Issues

- Financial Considerations (target margin or internal rate of return).
- Consistency in the product line (price of the Camry is not just influenced by the Accord or Taurus, but also by the prices of the Corolla and Avalon).
- Consistency in Image: Walmart can't sell expensive stuff.

Competitor Issues

- How will your competitor respond to your price? Will they be rational about selling?
- Willingness to respond on price? What's the cost to the competitor?
- Competitor position: Market leaders are more likely to initiate: followers are more likely to imitate.

Cx Issues?

- *Price sensitivity/Price elasticity.* What drives this?
- Psychological Issues. 

## 10.2

#### Price Sensitivity Affected By:
- Ease of Comparison: Private label products are places in a separate section because when beside the branded products there is an easier comparsion and higher price sensitivity.
- Expenditure: $500-$600 vs. $20500 vs. $20600.
- Shared Expenses. I'm less price sensitive if I know an institution is paying for me. It's also easier for me to be less price sensitive if there is a distance in terms of time. No pain of payment.
- Price/Quality Inferences. "Higher price means better!"

#### Measuring Price Sensitivity

Actual, or experimental. Controlled environment.

When prices were raised, demand went down a bit, but profits actually went up. :) Nobody studies every price (but this was done in the 1990s, not sure if this works today with the smartphones.)

Trade-off analysis: Present people with different types of stimuli. The kids that found Warby Parker figured out the cx willingness to pay ceiling. They were able to get the correct pricing by graphing shit.

To ask people, ask them indirectly. "On a scale from 1-7, how likely would you be likely to buy this product if it was priced at $95?"

Regression and statistical analysis.

Psychological Factors: 9 endings ($.99) to make it look cheapo.

## 10.3: Pricing Strategies 3: Psychological Factors

Mr. A won lotteries for $50 and $25. Mr. B won for $75. People think that Mr. A is happier, because when you have good news, it's better for it to be spread around. Better to give 3 boxes than 1 big box when giving out stuff for Xmas.

Integrate all bad news together.

Silver lining principle: Better to sell at $22K with a $2K rebate rather than sell at $20K.

Prospect theory: People have an internal reference point when they expect certain things in price. People respond differently to deviations from the reference point, either positive or negative. Lastly: Diminishing returns.

You have reference points in your mind of how much things should be charged. You also have this thingie called loss aversion.

## 10.4: Distribution Strategies 1: Introduction

How do channels of distribution develop what they do? (Who is doing what?)

Place is called the "Final Frontier" because it could be a source of sustainable competitive advantage. It can also provide increasing R2S. If you are everywhere, then you have a higher chance to win. (But it is also expensive.)

Any time a hard good gets converted to soft (as in software, hehehe) good creates a distribution advantage.

Direct vs. Indirect: A distributor (indirect) would decrease the number of transactions vs. direct channels.

#### Advantage of direct
- Higher barriers to entry
- Quality of direct market feedback, you own it
- Bundling with high-margin products/services

Ex of disruptions: Apps, Dell (make your own PC).

You want to construct a system of distribution that is optimized to reach whoever you want to reach.

## 10.5: Distribution Strategies 2: Channel Design

How many outlets to have in a given market?

- Exclusive: One individual distributing. Good if we want to have the strongest support. The cx's cost of obtaining the offering is not considered vital.
- Selective: Middle part.
- Intensive: Many individuals distributing. Good if we don't need selling support.

	Intro -> Growth -> Marketing -> Decline
	Home Video Specialist -> Circuit City -> Walmart -> Ebay
	Information -> Better logistics -> When they are familiar, we need the product to be available readily

Hybrid grid: A complex product means that many things need to be done to spread the product or service. And activities, once you decide what needs to be done, cannot be eliminated.

- Forwards integration: IKEA removed delivery.
- Backwards integration: Apple now sells its stuff via the store.
- Sideways shift: Amazon uses FedEx for delivery.

Channel margin = Compensation for performing function. How do we keep the channel coordinated?

#### Conflict

Manufacturers want everything to be taken, while distributors want to sell only the good products.

#### Vertical conflicts are conflicts between the manufacturers and retailers. 

- Ex: Nike came into trouble with Foot Locker, as FL didn't want to sell every SKU that Nike had.
- What happened is that Nike created flagship stores to eliminate conflict.
- Modify relationship from manufacturer-retailer to franchises, increase power.
- Monitor downstream partners and have some mystery shoppers to know what's going on, anyway.

#### Horizontal conflicts are conflicts between the different retailers.

- There is always a potential for free-riding. Low-service, low-price retailers hurt high-service, high-price retailers.
- Consumers can go to a high-service store, get educated, and they buy from the low-service store. I get the high service and buy from the low price.
- To fix: Establish boundaries between channels, or set an appropriate level of distribution intensity.

## 10.6: Horizontal Conflict

59% of people have used their device to find a better price while shopping in-store, and most of them buy from an online competitor.

This is why you need to touch cx on the virtual as well as the physical world.

1/3 of the online-buyers really wanted to buy online, but about 60% would have bought a product in the store, but ended up buying online.

Buy-online-pickup-in-store: Retailers offered that we can do "buy the thing online, then just go to the store". But what happened was that sales at the website went down, but sales at the store went up. (This was for home products, so what the cx did was they checked the product online, and then went to the store later.) What happend was ROPO (research online, purchase offline).

Cx want to check price online but see the product.

#### More strategies for managing horizontal conflict
- Establish boundaries between channels: Demarcate by cx, product classification, segmentation.
- Decrease distribution intensity so retailers are monopolies.
- Introduce multiple brands, different brands for different channels.

#### Determinants of Conflict
- Length of the Channel: How many intermediaries between us and the cx? Every time you add someone, you add a markup and a layer or margin.
- Autonomy: How much are owned, franchised, or are independent?
- Density: Single, dual, or multiple? When there's just one, no conflict. When 2, there is more conflict. Now when we get to a very high number of competitors, there is a lower conflict because "ok, fuck it".

## 10.7: The 7 M's (Targeting and Messaging)
- Major Media: People still like to watch TV, spending is up on media.

Classic Campaign, consumption of milk was going down. So what they wanted to do is to ask the people to know that they wouldn't want to lose milk when they went home.

#### _Got Milk?_
- Market: People who CURRENTLY drink milk
- Message content: Make sure you have enough milk (it complements many other meals)
- Mission: Increase milk consumption by one glass per week within a year
- Message design: Deprivation Campaign
- Media strategy: TV and print
- Money: ?? The problem with marketing is that you aren't sure if it's effective, and you're not sure what parts are effective.
- Measurement: 60% aided recall in 3 months, and therewas a 2.67% ($30M) increase in sales.

## 10.8: The Mission and Message (Rational Appeals)
- What are we trying to influence?
- The objectives of marketing communication is thinking. How do we change how people think? (Recall "pork the other white meat".)
- Mission: What are we trying to influence?

Action-Desire-Interest-Awareness

Share of Market-Share of Heart-Share of Mind

#### Rational Appeal
- Demonstration of the product
- Do this if the product has features that you really want cx to buy
- There's this thing that a spokesperson, personality would want. Danica Patrick, Martina Hingis, Michael Phelps.
- Charlie Brown as spokesperson for financial companies.
- Testimonials: Effective when a cx is going to be using this for a long time, and they aren't sure if they'd like it.
- Direct comparisons (US-context).
- Comparison (and Framing): BK frames "frame-broiled over fried" because frame-broiled sounds better. McDonalds frames "cooked on a hot stainles steel grill over cooked by passing raw meat through and open flame" because the former seems better.

## 10.9: The Mission and Message (Emotional Appeals)
- Fear is used by financial services, public interests, high-tech organizations. There is an "inverted-U" shape of effectiveness, a too fearful message actually sucks. It's very effective, doe.
- Positive emotions: "What a great job it is to be a mother, thank you mom."
- Subliminal advertising: No research on whether this is true or not.
- Gavin Fitzsimmons: Showing Apple logo = makes people more creative? Hihihi.

#### Method to Determine Marketing Budget
- Percentage of sales? Scales horribly.
- Match (or better competition)
- Parfitt-Collins Model: "If I need 6% to break even, how many people have to figure out that my product must exist?" Percentage percentage thingies.

Figure out the goal you want to achieve, and work backwards :)

## Quidsi Case Study

Quidsi: Founded 2005, "House of Brands", warehousing with robots, 1.2M sqm floor size, acquired 2011 $545M by Amazon. Good story of execution. Quidsi is the parent facing company, and each site (diapers.com, soap.com) is a different brand but are connected by a shopping cart, all of these target the same cx: the convenience-seeking mom.

We have success in the diaper space because we were specialists. The model continued from there, and we thought of each vertical that we need to go into.

The actual name diapers.com was very powerful, we knew that people were searching for diapers online and they weren't finding anything, so there was a first mover component to that. We knew that we can capitalize through the paid search channel. We knew that it was generic so we can take care of that. We tried getting a representative item per category, such as yoyo. We want a short domain.

First objective was to start with consumables, you need fast delivery + cx care to solidify the relationship by delivering things like diapers and pet food. Then we move to high-margin non-consumables. We look for things that cx wants to add to their basic basket.

Most e-commerce companies acquire customers through online channels liked paid search, affiliate marketing, shopping engines, but we also like more differentiated channels. We also have partnerships, print ads, outdoor marketing we go to market in a geographically targeted way.

We operate as an independent subsidiary of Amazon. Now we want to leverage the infrastructure in the US to grow the business. Many of our sites have been opened recently. We view our competition as other offline/online companies. We see the shift from offline to online shopping. There are many retail formats, we see that cx shop in different ways at diff times. We focus more on the cx rather than the competition.

It's not a focus for us to put up a physical store. When you have a physical store there is a different challenge. Everything that can be done online brings such more opportunities than trying to create a physical presence. 1 physical store, Beauty Space. It serves as a showroom and is for the relationship with the vendors.

As a vertical specialist, we want to have the products that people are looking for. We want an elevated shoppable experience. So where we have to have any product that anyone is looking for, but we want to feel very curated. We monitor and are aware of the pricing of the other companies but many things factor into that, and we consider the high-speed delivery and the customer care.

We are in customer intimacy. When we started, we were focused on the opportunity to serve a new mom, especially when they are in the time of their life where it is transitional. We want to establish a good relation, and that is how we got started. Once we grew we knew about the age of their baby, or their children, or if she had a pet, and we leverage that relationship so we can offer whatever is relevant to her. We want to be one step ahead of her, we want to not look like an expert but we want to be a trusted friend.

As we went into new categories, what we had in our mind was the things our cx wanted most. What would be the most natural thing that the parents need?

We spend a lot of time evaluating the cx and their overall value to us (CLV). We knew this was important because we start with low margin cx products. We were thinking money in the beginning with each individual cx, before they start buying high-margin products.

We aim to offer everything, but we certainly do evaluate cx segments based on characteristics that they buy on us. The cx who buys organic products has a higher lifetime value. So we want to focus on natural and organic.

We're very focused in cx acquisition. We are constantly testing and evaluating how we can get to the cx using the channels. Once we get a cx through the door, we have found that they tend to keep coming back. So there's a pretty predictable product to how they shop over time.

Now that we have launched 10 sites that serve a cx segment, we have teams of specialists that focus on each. And at the end of the day they serve the same cx.

Our strategy is still to go to market with leading with our consumables. But once they go through the door, we offer the ten sites (retention strategy). Recent brand: _Familyhood_. This connects all of our sites, it represents service, and help us tell the story.

We aspire to develop products outside, but we want to stay focused on to the right offering products for our cx, the new mom. Ex: housekeeping services, etc.

- Cx value: You have to give something to the cx that has value and that they're willing to pay for.
- Differential advantage: You need to give something to the cx that is not delivered by the competition.
- There are people who value every different thing. So at some point, you have to concentrate on different cx.

Since diapers.com was first in a new space, they were able to be product-focused. Though, you still need to know when to pivot from the product-centered to cx-centered. As you move into a mature market, you focus on competition and branding. In 2013, it's hard to be a jerk because people are able to see if you do bad things. Brands now are about narratives, about the people who work there, the values of the company, much more than the logo.
